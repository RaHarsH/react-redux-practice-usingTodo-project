Below is a sample `README.md` file for your React-Redux Todo project. It outlines how you learned React-Redux and Redux Toolkit, the concepts of a single source of truth, store configuration, slices, and the use of `useSelector` and `useDispatch`.

# React Redux Todo Project

This project is a simple Todo application built with **React** and **Redux Toolkit**. The main goal of this project is to understand the concepts of **React-Redux**, including the Redux Toolkit, which helps simplify Redux state management by providing tools like `createSlice` and `configureStore`.

## What I Learned

### 1. **React-Redux**
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. React-Redux is the official binding library for React and Redux. It allows React components to interact with the Redux store using hooks like `useSelector` and `useDispatch`.

### 2. **Redux Toolkit**
The Redux Toolkit is the recommended way to write Redux logic. It simplifies the Redux store setup process and reduces boilerplate by providing utility functions such as `createSlice`, `configureStore`, and `createAsyncThunk`.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Single Source of Truth**
The entire state of the application is stored in one central place: the **Redux Store**. This "single source of truth" ensures that every component in the application gets its state from one place, making debugging easier and predictable.

```js
// src/store.js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import todoReducer from '../features/todo/TodoSlice'

// Configuring the store
export const store = configureStore({
    reducer: todoReducer,
})
```

Here, we configure the store using `configureStore` from Redux Toolkit, and we provide it with the `todoReducer`, which manages the Todo state.

### 2. **Configuring the Store**
The store is the central part of a Redux application. It holds the global state of the application. To configure the store in Redux Toolkit, we use the `configureStore` method.

```js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import todoReducer from '../features/todo/TodoSlice';

// Configuring the store
export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    todo: todoReducer,
  },
});
```

### 3. **Creating Slices**
A "slice" in Redux Toolkit is a collection of Redux reducer logic and actions for a single feature of the app. It contains an initial state, reducers, and actions.

#### TodoSlice

The `TodoSlice` manages the state of todos. It includes two main actions: `addTodo` and `removeTodo`.

```js
import { createSlice, nanoid } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const initialState = {
  todos: [{ id: 1, text: 'Hello World' }],
};

export const TodoSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'todo',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    addTodo: (state, action) => {
      const todo = {
        id: nanoid(),
        text: action.payload,
      };
      state.todos.push(todo);
    },
    removeTodo: (state, action) => {
      state.todos = state.todos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== action.payload);
    },
  },
});

export const { addTodo, removeTodo } = TodoSlice.actions;
export default TodoSlice.reducer;
```

#### Explanation:
- `addTodo`: Adds a new todo to the list, with a unique `id` generated by `nanoid` and the `text` provided by the action payload.
- `removeTodo`: Removes a todo by filtering out the one with the matching `id`.

## Accessing the Store

To access the state and dispatch actions in a React component, we use two essential hooks provided by `react-redux`:

### 1. **useSelector**
This hook allows us to access the state in the Redux store.

**Syntax**:
```js
const todos = useSelector((state) => state.todo.todos);
```

### 2. **useDispatch**
This hook provides the ability to dispatch actions to the Redux store.

**Syntax**:
```js
const dispatch = useDispatch();
dispatch(addTodo('New Todo'));
```

## Using the Store in the Todo Project

Here's how to use `useSelector` and `useDispatch` to access the store and modify the state in your React components.

### Example Component: AddTodo

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { addTodo } from '../features/todo/TodoSlice';

const AddTodo = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    dispatch(addTodo(text));
    setText('');
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Enter Todo"
      />
      <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default AddTodo;
```

### Example Component: TodoList

```js
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { removeTodo } from '../features/todo/TodoSlice';

const TodoList = () => {
  const todos = useSelector((state) => state.todo.todos);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map((todo) => (
        <li key={todo.id}>
          {todo.text}
          <button onClick={() => dispatch(removeTodo(todo.id))}>
            Remove
          </button>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default TodoList;
```

## Conclusion

This project taught me the fundamental concepts of managing global state using **Redux** and the **Redux Toolkit** in React applications. The use of `createSlice`, `configureStore`, `useSelector`, and `useDispatch` simplifies the state management and makes the code more maintainable and predictable.

Remember to always maintain a **single source of truth** by keeping only one `store.js` file and organizing your state using slices.

### Key Redux Terms
- **Store**: The centralized state container.
- **Reducers**: Pure functions that determine how the state changes in response to actions.
- **Actions**: Objects that represent changes to the state.
- **Dispatch**: A function that sends actions to the store.
- **Selectors**: Functions that read the state from the store.
